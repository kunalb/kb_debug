Requires at least: WordPress 3.0
Tested up to: 3.2
Stable tag: 0.2.2

Debug your plugins and themes.

== Description ==

* Call `kb_debug` with any arguments that you want to log and they will be pretty printed at the end of the document.
* To log and show a list of all warnings, errors and notices generated by your plugin, add  `?KB_Debug_Errors` to your URL. 
* To see a list of all hooks in the order they fire as well as what arguments they are called with and what functions run on them (again, in which order),
  add a `?KB_Debug_Hooks` to the URL.

To see both just add ?KB_Debug_Errors&KB_Debug_Hooks. (Essentially $_GET[var] must be set to enable that feature).

== Installation ==
Upload `kb_debug.php` and 'kb-debug.css' to the `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory. (Create this directory if it doesn't exist).

NOTE: These files must be placed directly under mu-plugins: ie mu-plugins/kb_debug.php and mu-plugins/kb-debug.css.

Putting these into mu-plugins allows the plugin to capture the most number of hooks it can.


== Features ==
* Logs and displays all warnings, errors, etc. alongwith their context.
* Logs and displays all hooks alongwith the argument(s) each hook is called with and the functions that run on that particular hook (in order).
