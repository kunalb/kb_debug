Debug your plugins and themes.

== Description ==

To log and show a list of all warnings, errors and notices generated by your plugin, add a ?KB_Debug_Errors to your URL. To see a list of all hooks in the order they fire as well as what arguments they are called with and what functions run on them (again, in which order), add a ?KB_Debug_Hooks to the URL.

To see both just add ?KB_Debug_Errors&KB_Debug_Hooks. (Essentially $_GET[var] must be set to enable that feature).
