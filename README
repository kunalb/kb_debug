KB_Debug
========

A swiss army knife for debugging WordPress/BuddyPress plugins.

Drop this into wp-content/mu-plugins/ to start logging notices and warnings and displaying them.

WP_DEBUG must be set to true for anything to display.

DO NOT USE THIS ON PRODUCTION SITES.

Set the following constants anywhere in your code to display:

# KB_DISPLAY_HOOKS Set to true to display hooks, as well as functions called with arguments. Only use with modern browsers that can handle lots of data.
# KB_FORCE_HIDE Sometimes, you might not want to display anything. Setting this to true ensures that nothing is displayed.
